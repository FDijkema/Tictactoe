Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game using Python and the Pygame library for the user interface. The game allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in Python programming and provide some example code for discussion.

Features

Two-player gameplay (player 1 (O) and player 2 (X))
Graphical user interface using Pygame
Simple and intuitive design
Highlighting the winning combination

Requirements

Python 3.x
Pygame library
Numpy library
Pytest library for testing

How to Play

Run the file src/main.py

A window will open with a 3x3 grid.

Player 1 (O) starts the game by clicking on an empty cell to place their mark.

Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks.

The game detects and highlights the winning combination.

The game ends when there is a winner or a draw.
